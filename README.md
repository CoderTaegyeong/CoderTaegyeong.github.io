Hello, this is my portfolio version 2. I'll update if I have more things to show you. I welcome all advices. Send through my email address, please.(not via contact form) :)

## Notice
Due to privacy reasons, I didn't put my credentials on my PHPMailer code. So the contact form does NOT work. Sorry. I need more secure and private server to upload such information. With my credentials, it works on my localhost, except that I can't customize the sender address. Other than that, it sends me a mail I sent from the contact form.

There's an option for Korean now. Click the global icon on the left-top to hide the language selector options, re-click to reveal it again.

## Progress
Almost finished, but I think I need more projects to put in. I'm going to put just one or two more. (June 22th, 2020)

## Issues
I fixed the issue Korean button didn't work. And now I realized I didn't put a contact page in Korean. I thought I finished translating..
