Hello, this is my portfolio version 2. I'll update if I have more things to show you. I welcome any advice. Send them through my email address, please.(not via contact form) :)

## Notice
Due to privacy reasons, I didn't put my credentials on my PHPMailer code. So the contact form does NOT work. Sorry. I need more secure and private server to upload such information. With my credentials, it works on my localhost, except that I can't customize the sender address. I used "AddReplyTo" function to substitute "setFrom", and it shows the sender address with ReplyTo, not From. I couldn't solve this problem.

There's an option for Korean now. Click the global icon on the left-top to hide the language selector options, re-click to reveal it again.

## Progress
I don't think I'll get any back-end job with this poorly-made portfolio. I'll be back after studying Java and put more stuff.(July 19th, 2020)
