Hello, this is my portfolio version 2. I'll update if I have more things to show you. I welcome all advices. :)

## Notice
Due to privacy reasons, I didn't put my credentials on my PHPMailer code. So the contact form does NOT work. Sorry. I need more secure and private server to upload such information. With my credentials, it works on my localhost, except that I can't customize the sender address. Other than that, it sends me a mail I sent from the contact form.

## Progress
Finished index, resume, and contact pages. Working on some projects to add to Portfolio page. Will remove and adjust things. (June 21, 2020)

## Issues
It works now! (June 21, 2020)

* Languages: HTML5, CSS3, PHP(v7.4.2), JavaScript
