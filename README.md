Hello, this is my portfolio version 2. I'll update if I have more things to show you. I welcome all advices. :)

## Notice
Due to privacy reasons, I didn't put my credentials on my PHPMailer code. So the contact form does NOT work. Sorry. I need more secure and private server to upload such information. With my credentials, it works on my localhost, except that I can't customize the sender address. Other than that, it sends me a mail I sent from the contact form.

## Progress
Finished adding the explanation of project 1 on Portfolio page. Adding a language selection button for Korean pages and an option to enlarge a photo on Portfolio. (June 22th, 2020)

## Issues
It works now! (June 21, 2020)
